## About KAYOS

KAYOS is a dynamic and forward-thinking social media company dedicated to redefining how the world connects. With a strong commitment to excellence, KAYOS aspires to be the gold standard in social connectivity by creating a platform that goes beyond simple interactions and fosters meaningful relationships. Our platform is designed to mirror the connections we’ve cultivated in our YearUp cohort.

When you log in to the website, you’ll notice a background that prominently features imagery of the YearUp cohort. This intentional design choice underscores the importance of the relationships within our group, visually reinforcing the strong bonds that define the YearUp community.

Throughout the development process, we leveraged an API to collect and display data. This functionality is seamlessly integrated into the platform.

Our post page/feed allows you to create posts and view contributions from others in the community, fostering an interactive and connected environment.
