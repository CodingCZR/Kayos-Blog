# Enjoy the Microblog Project and the MicroblogLite API!

Don't forget to read the [*MicroblogLite* API docs](https://microbloglite.herokuapp.com/docs/) and experiment with the API in *Postman!*

Practice and experimentation provide experience, and experience provides confidence.


Welcome to out platform KAYOS! a dynamic and forward-thinking social media company on a mission to redefine the way the world connects. With an unwavering commitment to excellence, Kayos has set out to be the epitome of social connectivity, striving to create a platform that goes beyond mere interactions and fosters meaningful relationships. We wanted to create a platform that ties in to the relationships we have today in our yearup cohart!


Upon logging into the website, one immediately notices that the background prominently features the collective imagery of the YearUp cohort. This deliberate design choice serves to visually emphasize the significance of the relationships within the cohort. By utilizing this feature, we aim to establish a profound connection, highlighting the meaningful relationships that form the foundation of the YearUp community.
